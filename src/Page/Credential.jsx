            <p className="text-white opacity-80 text-[1.1rem] leading-normal tracking-wide">
              I have successfully earned a Higher National Diploma in Computing,
              a significant achievement that reflects my dedication and passion
              for software engineering. This two-year program exposed me to a
              comprehensive array of subjects, each contributing to my holistic
              understanding of the field. In my first year, I embarked on a
              journey through 17 subjects, where I honed my skills in essential
              areas. The programming subject, centered around Java and
              Object-Oriented Programming, not only expanded my coding expertise
              but also allowed me to apply these concepts in practical Java
              programming projects. Networking became a forte as I delved deep
              into the intricacies of network infrastructure construction using
              tools like Packet Tracer. Professional Practice was instrumental
              in fostering my teamwork, communication, and time management
              abilities, equipping me with vital soft skills crucial in a
              professional setting. Database Design and Development taught me
              the step-by-step process of constructing relational databases such
              as paring keys,normalization etc.., with a practical
              implementation using MYSQL. In security subject, I gained
              invaluable insights into the digital threats that loom in our
              interconnected world and learned how to defend against them along
              with the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity. Managing
              Successful Computing Projects exposed me to project management
              techniques and tools like Microsoft Project, emphasizing the
              importance of schedule and time management. Web Design and
              Development allowed me to create visually appealing and
              user-friendly e-commerce websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
              Bootstrap and I had to design & develop an e-commerce web using
              that tech stack to pass that subject. Math for Computing
              introduced me to various number systems such as binary,octal,
              decimal & hexa decimal and illuminated the profound connections
              between mathematics and computer science. <br />
              In my second year, I delved even deeper into advanced topics.
              Internet of Things (IoT) challenged me to learn the C language and
              employ it in a practical projectâ€”designing a blind spot detector
              for cars using Arduino boards to pass that subject(if you want to
              know about that project I can show you). Data Structure and
              Algorithm deepened my understanding of the crucial role these
              elements play in program efficiency, emphasizing space and time
              complexitiesI even have to design and develop a java based program
              using the appropirate data structure & algorithm to make thta
              program most efficient based on time & space complexity
              measurement in order to pass that subject.. Discrete Math
              showcased how advanced mathematical concepts like Dijkstra's and
              Bellman-Ford algorithms are employed in network optimization.
              Computing Research Project honed my research skills as I undertook
              a substantial research project on a topic of my choice. Cloud
              Computing introduced me to the dynamic world of cloud
              technologies, a cornerstone of modern computing. Business
              Intelligence allowed me to explore data science and leverage the
              power of tools like Power BI for in-depth data analysis i even
              have to make project to show alot collected data in easily
              understandable way using poerBI. Finally, Advanced Programming
              challenged me to learn Dart and Flutter, enabling me to design and
              develop mobile applications. My flutter project and experiences
              from that advanced programming subject can be explored in my
              GitHub repository and work section, showcasing my hands-on
              expertise and growth throughout the program. my My Higher National
              Diploma in Computing represents not just a certificate but a
              testament to my commitment to software engineering and my
              readiness to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology
